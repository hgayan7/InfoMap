# InfoMap
Android app which uses Geocoding API,Maps API and openweathermap's API to show a location on the map and get it's current weather conditions.I have also used map styling.

Geocoding API key,MAPs API key and openweathermap's API key are needed for this app.Just replace the string which asks for API keys and you are good to go.
